        <h2>Taylor Ballantyne</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Taylor Ballantyne. I am the oldest of 3 and have lived in Utah my whole life. Some hobbies I enjoy are painting, reading, wood working, and sports.</p>
        
        <p>I was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints. My favorite qoute has always been "As we look for humor seek for the eternal perspective, understand the principle of compensation, and draw near to our Heavenly Father, we can endure hardship and trial. We can say as did my mother, Come what may and Love it" By Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin. I have tried to live my life to that qoute.</p>
        
          <p> I currently work in collections for Zions Bank I have worked there for 8 years. I am the call no one wants to get if thier account is negative for past due. I am in the process of working towards a Bachelors Degree in Web and computer programming.</p>
