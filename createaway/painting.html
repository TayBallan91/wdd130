                <p>From Watercolor to Oil and Acrylic paints we have the courses for you. Painting is a great way to release stress, anxiety or express how you are feeling when you don’t have the words. Nadia Boulanger stated “Art is not an emotion. Art is a medium in which emotion is expressed.” Whatever you are feeling let that it flow through your painting. Though painting can seem daunting at first if you go into it knowing that it doesn’t have to be perfect you will find that it can be a freeing experience. The most amazing thing about paintings and art is that they have the ability to move people and create conversations. Bob Ross once said “We don’t make mistakes. We just have happy accidents.” Take what you think is a mistake and make it into something different. Let your paint, and canvas guide you to tell the story that wants to be told. Anyone can be a painter. Mix the colors your own way. Don’t be afraid to let your brushstrokes shoe, and above all make sure your art has a soul.</p>
