                <h2>Art of Carpentry</h2>
                <p>Woodworking is a form of art that I don’t think gets talked about very often. But if you look the intricacies of a wooden door or figurine made of wood. It takes a lot of hard work and precision to create something out of wood. Each piece of wood has a personality about it. One might have a lot of knots in it, one may be blemish free. Another can have a bend to it. As you look at the wood and use the personality you will be able to create beautiful works of art. “True Art is Characterized by the irresistible urge in the creative artist.” There is nothing quite like the feeling of creating something beautiful. To take raw materials and transform them into something useful and appealing to the eye is an art. Every woodworker starts out as a beginner. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, they are a part of learning and may be just want you need understand the wood or your tools better. There is a saying that “the laborer works with his hands, the craftsman with his head, but the artist works with his heart.”.</p>
