      <h3>Learning to Paint</h3>
      <p>
        From Watercolor to Oil and Acrylic paints we have the courses for you.  Painting is a great way to release stress, anxiety or express how you are feeling when you don’t have the words. Nadia Boulanger stated “Art is not an emotion. Art is a medium in which emotion is expressed.”  Whatever you are feeling let that it flow through your painting. Though painting can seem daunting at first if you go into it knowing that it doesn’t have to be perfect you will find that it can be a freeing experience. The most amazing thing about paintings and art is that they have the ability to move people and create conversations. Bob Ross once said “We don’t make mistakes. We just have happy accidents.” Take what you think is a mistake and make it into something different. Let your paint, and canvas guide you to tell the story that wants to be told. Anyone can be a painter. Mix the colors your own way. Don’t be afraid to let your brushstrokes shoe, and above all make sure your art has a soul.

      <h3>Art of Carpentry</h3>
      <p>
        Woodworking is a form of art that I don’t think gets talked about very often. But if you look the intricacies of a wooden door or figurine made of wood. It takes a lot of hard work and precision to create something out of wood. Each piece of wood has a personality about it. One might have a lot of knots in it, one may be blemish free. Another can have a bend to it. As you look at the wood and use the personality you will be able to create beautiful works of art. “True Art is Characterized by the irresistible urge in the creative artist.” There is nothing quite like the feeling of creating something beautiful. To take raw materials and transform them into something useful and appealing to the eye is an art. Every woodworker starts out as a beginner. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, they are a part of learning and may be just want you need understand the wood or your tools better. There is a saying that “the laborer works with his hands, the craftsman with his head, but the artist works with his heart.”.
